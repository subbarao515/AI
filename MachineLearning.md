# Machine Learning

Machine learning has its origins in statistics and mathematical modeling of data. <br/>
The fundamental idea of machine learning is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.
* Machine learning model is a software application that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on one or more input values
* The process of defining data in function is known as **Training**
* Predict new values in a process using fucntion is called **inferencing**
* A **label** in machine learning is the correct answer or target output that you want your model to learn to predict

## Types of machine learning

* **Supervised machine learning** is the training data includes both feature values and known label values.  
  * Supervised machine learning determining a relationship between the features and labels in past observations, so that unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.
    
* Regression is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label predicted by the model is a numeric value.
* Classification is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label represents a categorization, or class
    * **binary classification** : Label determines whether the observed item is (or isn't) an instance of a specific class
       ### Binary classification evaluation metrics
          * Accuracy 
          * Recall
          * Precision
          * F1-score
 -  Area Under the Curve (AUC)
    * **Multiclass classification** extends binary classification to predict a label that represents one of multiple possible classes  

* **Unsupervised machine** learning involves training models using data that consists only of feature values without any known labels
  * **Clustering** in unsupervised learning is the process of grouping unlabeled data points into clusters based on their similarity to one another.

### Regression evaluation metrics
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Coefficient of determination (R2)
* Iterative training

# Deep learning
Deep learning  is an advanced form of machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns.

 * Deep learning is the creation of an artificial  neural network

# Transformers
Generative AI applications are powered by language models, which are a specialized type of machine learning model that you can use to perform natural language processing (NLP).

Transformer model architecture consists of two components:

Encoder : An encoder block that creates semantic representations of the training vocabulary.  
Decoder : A decoder block that generates new language sequences.  

# Tokenization
A transformer model is to decompose the training text into tokens is called Tokenization

# Embeddings
* Vectors represent lines in multidimensional space, describing direction and distance along multiple axes.

# Below steps for Tranining the model.

1. **Define the problem**: Decide on what the model should predict and when it's successful.
2. **Get the data**: Find data sources and get access.
3. **Prepare the data**: Explore the data. Clean and transform the data based on the model's requirements.
4. **Train the model**: Choose an algorithm and hyperparameter values based on trial and error.
5. **Integrate the model**: Deploy the model to an endpoint to generate predictions.
6. **Monitor the model**: Track the model's performance.
