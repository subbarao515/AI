# Machine Learning

Machine learning has its origins in statistics and mathematical modeling of data.  
The fundamental idea is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.

- **Machine learning model**: A software function that calculates output from one or more input values.
- The process of defining data in a function is called **Training**.
- Using the function to predict new values is called **Inferencing**.
- A **Label** is the correct answer or target output to teach the model.

## Types of Machine Learning

![Types of Machine Learning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e411432b-80e0-4f85-96a6-4eb0ade98839)

- **Supervised Learning**: Training data has both feature values and known label values.  
  - Finds relationships between features and labels so future cases can be predicted.
  - **Regression**: Predicted label is numeric.
  - **Classification**: Predicted label is categorical.
    - **Binary Classification**: Predicts if item is (or isn't) in a specific class.
      - **Evaluation Metrics**:
        - Accuracy
        - Recall
        - Precision
        - F1-score
        - Area Under Curve (AUC)
    - **Multiclass Classification**: Predicts one of multiple possible classes.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Trains on feature values only; no labels.
  - **Clustering**: Groups unlabeled data based on similarity.

### Regression Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)
- Iterative Training

# Deep Learning

Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning inspired by the human brain.

- **Deep Learning**: Constructs artificial neural networks.

---

# Transformers

Generative AI uses large language models (LLMs), a special machine learning model type, to perform natural language processing (NLP).

- **Encoder**: Creates semantic representations of the vocabulary.
- **Decoder**: Generates new language sequences.

---

# Tokenization

- Splitting text into tokens for model processing.

---

# Embeddings

- Representing words or phrases as vectors (lines in multi-dimensional space).

# Steps for Training a Model

1. **Define the problem**: What should the model predict?
2. **Get the data**: Locate and access data sources.
3. **Prepare the data**: Clean and transform data for modeling.
4. **Train the model**: Choose an algorithm and tune hyperparameters.
5. **Integrate the model**: Deploy to make predictions.
6. **Monitor the model**: Track and ensure performance.

# Core Machine Learning Tasks

1. **Classification**: Predict categories.
2. **Regression**: Predict numbers.
3. **Time-series Forecasting**: Predict future values in ordered data.
4. **Computer Vision**: Image classification/object detection.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extract insights from text/data[3][5][8].
