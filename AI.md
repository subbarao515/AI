### What is AI
Artificial intelligence(AI) is imitates human behaviors and capabilities.  
* Machine learning-  use data to create a predictive model 
* Computer vision
  * Image classification
  * Object detection
  * Semantic segmentation
  * Image analysis
  * Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  * Optical character recognition (OCR)
* Natural language processing
* Document intelligence
* Generative AI

### Machine learning
It is statistics and mathematical modeling of data.

Types of machine learning
* **Supervised machine learning**
  * Regression
  * Classification
     * Binary classification
     * Multiclass classification
* **Unsupervised machine learning**
  *  Clustering
 
### Computer vision
Computer vision is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI).Focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.  
Filter is convolved across the image, this kind of image manipulation is often referred to as convolutional filtering
* convolutional neural network (CNN)  
#### Below are foundation models
* Image classification: Identifying to which category an image belongs.
* Object detection: Locating individual objects within an image.
* Captioning: Generating appropriate descriptions of images.
* Tagging: Compiling a list of relevant text tags for an image.

### Facial Recognition

 **Face detection, analysis, and recognition are important capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions**
 * Detection
 * Analysis
 * recongnition  
 Use cases
 * Security ,Social media,Intelligent monitoring,Advertising,Missing persons and Identity validation  
### Optical character recognition
Computer vision to "read" the text, and then natural language processing capabilities make sense of it.

### Natural language processing
Natural language processing supports applications that can see, hear, speak understand users.
