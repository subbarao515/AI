### What is AI
Artificial intelligence(AI) is imitates human behaviors and capabilities.  
* Machine learning-  use data to create a predictive model 
* Computer vision
  * Image classification
  * Object detection
  * Semantic segmentation
  * Image analysis
  * Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  * Optical character recognition (OCR)
* Natural language processing
* Document intelligence
* Generative AI

### Machine learning
It is statistics and mathematical modeling of data.

Types of machine learning
* **Supervised machine learning**
  * Regression
  * Classification
     * Binary classification
     * Multiclass classification
* **Unsupervised machine learning**
  *  Clustering
 
### Computer vision
Computer vision is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI).Focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.  
Filter is convolved across the image, this kind of image manipulation is often referred to as convolutional filtering
* convolutional neural network (CNN)  
#### Below are foundation models
* Image classification: Identifying to which category an image belongs.
* Object detection: Locating individual objects within an image.
* Captioning: Generating appropriate descriptions of images.
* Tagging: Compiling a list of relevant text tags for an image.

### Facial Recognition

 **Face detection, analysis, and recognition are important capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions**
 * Detection
 * Analysis
 * recongnition  
 Use cases
 * Security ,Social media,Intelligent monitoring,Advertising,Missing persons and Identity validation  
### Optical character recognition
Computer vision to "read" the text, and then natural language processing capabilities make sense of it.

### Natural language processing
Natural language processing supports applications that can see, hear, speak understand users.  

Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are part  of NLP

### Text Analysis
Entity Recognition,Entity linking,PII and PHI detection,Language Sentiment analysis and opinion mining,
summarization,text analysis.

An entity is an item of a particular type or a category

### Conversational AI 
It enable a dialog between an AI agent and a human.conversational AI agents are known as bots. utterances, entities, and intents are core concepts for Convenrational AI
Below 3 are part of Conversational AL
* Authoring
* Training the model
* Predicting

### Document intelligence
Document intelligence is AI capabilities  support processing text and making sense of information in text.      
Document intelligence can identify specific data such as the merchant's name, merchant's address, total value, and tax value
* It automates the process of extracting, understanding, and saving the data in text.
* Its extension of optical character recognition (OCR)
#### Document analysis
The ability to extract text, layout, and key-value pairs are known as document analysis.    
Document analysis provides locations of text on a page identified by bounding box coordinates.
It dependent on machine learning models that are trained to recognize data in text

### Knowledge mining
Extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data
