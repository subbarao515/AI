# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) imitates human behaviors and capabilities.

### Major AI Domains
- **Machine Learning**: Uses data to create a predictive model.
- **Computer Vision**:
  - Image classification
  - Object detection
  - Semantic segmentation
  - Image analysis
  - Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  - Optical character recognition (OCR)
- **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)
- **Document Intelligence**
- **Generative AI**

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is rooted in statistics and mathematical modeling.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Machine Learning**
  - Regression
  - Classification
    - Binary classification
    - Multiclass classification
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning**
  - Clustering

---

## Computer Vision

Computer vision enables AI to "see" and interpret visual data using concepts like convolutional filtering (with convolutional neural networks, or CNNs).

### Foundation Models in Computer Vision
- **Image Classification:** Identify the category of an image.
- **Object Detection:** Locate and identify objects within an image.
- **Captioning:** Generate descriptions for images.
- **Tagging:** Assign relevant text labels to images.

## Facial Recognition

Facial recognition provides:
- **Detection**
- **Analysis**
- **Recognition**

**Use Cases:** Security, social media, intelligent monitoring, advertising, missing persons, and identity validation.

---

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Allows computer vision to "read" text from images, while NLP interprets that text.

---

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Enables systems to see, hear, speak, and understand users.

**Examples:**
- Speech recognition
- Speech synthesis

---

## Text Analysis

Includes:
- Entity recognition & linking
- PII and PHI detection
- Language sentiment analysis & opinion mining
- Summarization

_An “entity” is an item of a particular type or category._

---

## Conversational AI

Enables dialogues between AI agents (“bots”) and humans.

**Core Concepts:**
- Utterances
- Entities
- Intents

**Main Processes:**
1. Authoring
2. Training the model
3. Predicting

## Document Intelligence

Enables automated processing, extraction, and understanding of vital information from text documents.

- Can identify specific data such as merchant's name, address, value, etc.
- Automates and extends OCR with advanced document analysis.
- Extracts text, layout, and key-value pairs using bounding box coordinates.

---

## Knowledge Mining

- Extracts useful information from large, often unstructured, datasets.

---

## Responsible and Trusted AI

- **Reliability and Safety:** Ensure AI systems function as designed and resist manipulation.
- **Accountability:** Implement human oversight and override mechanisms.
- **Privacy and Security:** Equip users to control data collection, use, and storage.

---

## Example Usage Areas

- **Computer Vision:** Identifying objects, analyzing letters
- **NLP:** Sentiment analysis
- **Anomaly Detection:** Fraud
- **Machine Learning (Regression):** Predictive analysis
