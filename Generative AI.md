# 1. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create new content and ideas**, such as conversations, stories, images, videos, and music[2][5].
- It extends neural networks and imitates human behavior using machine learning techniques.
- **Powered by:** Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **Capabilities:** Able to generate data that resembles real data by learning from vast datasets.

# 2. What are Foundation Models (FM)?

Generative AI relies on very large machine learning models, pre-trained on diverse data, known as **foundation models (FMs)**.
- **FMs** are the backbone that allow generative AI to handle a range of tasks.
- The key types of foundation models:
  1. **Text-to-Text:** Converts input text into output text (e.g., language translation, summarization).
  2. **Text-to-Embeddings:** Represents text as numerical vectors for comparison or further processing.
  3. **Multimodal:** Handles and generates multiple types of data (e.g., both text and images)[2][5].

# 3. What is Discriminative AI?

Discriminative AI models focus on **distinguishing between different classes or labels** in data[1][2][3].
- These models learn the boundaries between categories, making them ideal for **classification tasks** (e.g., spam detection, image recognition).
- **Objective:** Predict the probability or label of input data, rather than generating new data.
- **Example Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees.
