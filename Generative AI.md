**1.What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.<br/>
generative AI extends neural networks 

* It imitates human behavior by using machine learning   
* Its powered by large language models (LLMs)

**2.What is foundation models(FM)?**

 Generative AI is powered by very large machine learning models that are pre-trained on vast collections of data are commonly referred to as foundation models(FMS).<br/>

 Now 3 types of FMs are available <br/>
   1. Text-to-text <br/>
   2. Text-to-embeddings
   3. Multimodal
    
**3.Discriminative AI**
Discriminative models learn to distinguish between different classes or labels of data
