**Prompt is piece of text which used to get the response from LLM modes**

**Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear instructions to guide AI systems**

* Large Language Models (LLMs)
   *  Volume of training data
   *  Contextual understanding
   *  Machine learning and AI integration
   *  Versatility
* Tuning Types
    * Fine-tuning
    * LoRA(Learning to Rank)  fine-tuning

# AI Formatting 
 - Raw
   - Raw text is the simplest form of formatting
 - Structured Text
   - basic formatting elementsâ€”bulleted and numbered lists, delimiters, markdown
 - Formatted Data
   -  use various formatting options(JSON, XML, HTML, YAML or other similar format)

- Prompt Parameters
  - A crucial role in shaping how a language model responds to input
    - Temperature
      -  Temperature is a parameter that influences the "creativity" and randomness of the AI's output
     - Max Tokens
       - Max tokens determine the maximum output length of the AI's response.
- Advanced Prompt Parameters
    - API Requests
      - Sampling Parameters
        -  allow control of how the model selects tokens for the output.
      - Stop sequences
         - specific words, phrases, or characters that signal the model to stop generating text.
- Prompt Tuning Process
  - process of iteratively modifying and improving prompts to better align with specific objectives or requirements
- Shot-based Prompting Techniques
  -   Refers to the number of examples provided to the model in your prompt
      - Zero-Shot
         - Instructing a model to perform a task without providing any examples or demonstrations.
      - Few-Shot
        - Instructing a model to perform a task by providing several examples within the prompt.
- Sequential Prompting Techniques
    - Chain-of-Thought
      - This technique where the model is encouraged to break down its reasoning process step-by-step to arrive at an answer.
    - Prompt Chaining
      - This technique for breaking down a complex task into a series of smaller, interconnected prompts. 
- Context-Guiding Prompting Techniques
   - Hint 
        - A hint usually consists of a word or phrase that nudges the model in the desired direction or clarifies a particular concept
   - Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP)
        - Uses hints to guide AI responses
   - Generate Knowledge Prompting (GKP)
     - Involves asking the LLM to first generate relevant information or knowledge about a topic before answering a specific question or producing the final solution
- Prompting Best Practices
  - Writing Effective Prompts
    - Clear and Specific Request
    - Keep Focus
    - Input Length
    - Use Clear Formatting
    - New Dialogue
  - Refining Prompts
    - Regenerate Results
    - Rephrase Prompt
    - Adjust Components and Parameters
    - Apply Prompt Techniques
    - Dividing Complex Tasks
